# This is the first commit of the react project for per scholas!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This program uses axios to pull data from an API! It also uses the useState and UseEffect hooks! I used the rest country api for this project after that I used the react hooks and state to manipulate my data for the user. I tried to maintain and average of 5 commit per day I utilized browser router, usestate hooks and my main focus was to make sure my api was working at all points! I have included two of my favorite projects on my about page to demonstrate my understanding of coding, I uses a git hub logo for additional styling. I used marquee again, and just a outer space like background for the 2 pages of my project! I enjoyed learning more about axios and even found a cool method that put commas in the number of people in my population js variable My main goal in this project was to make sure that my api was always working through axios. On my about page I included relative information about myself that would be useful for employment.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
